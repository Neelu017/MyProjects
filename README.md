Title: Phishing Detection System Through Hybrid Machine Learning based on URL

. Phishing is a cyber-attack method where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information.

. It often involves fake websites that mimic legitimate ones.

. This project focuses on detecting phishing attempts based solely on the URL, using machine learning techniques.



Algorithms Used:
.Random Forest
.XGBoost
.Naive Bayes
.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
.Hybrid Model = Voting Classifier combining RF + XGBoost + SVM
.Reason for hybrid: Combine strengths of different classifiers
